# Robotics and XR

For this class, me and my team developed the `XploreR` project. Here's a preview of the `README.md` in the project repository:

 __Autonomous Exploration with Virtual Reality Visualization__  
The XploreR project is the result of eight weeks of work in cooperation with the [Karelics](https://karelics.fi) company for the Robotics and XR class in University of Eastern Finland, lectured by Professor Ilkka Jormanainen. The aim of this project was to integrate an autonomous exploration algorithm in a SLAM-equipped robot and link it to a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, allowing visualization of the robotâ€™s published data (e.g., the map, pose, path, etc.).
